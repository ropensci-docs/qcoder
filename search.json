Collaboration. Several aspects collaboration qualitative research present challenges development use QDA software. first challenge relates version control tracking changes. Whereas contributors open source software community, perhaps software development community generally, developed processes sharing code, data, work products, qualitative researchers often rely email, DropBox/box, sharing technologies lack appropriate version control features. One proposed solution implement system record-keeping maintains files akin Atlas.TI’s bundling unbundling process, permits simultaneous work comparison/merging changes. might also consider urging users learn git facilitate skill development offering tutorials. second collaboration challenge relates need establish inter-rater inter-coder reliability. Existing methods assessing inter-rater reliability QDA include Cronbach’s Alpha Krippendorff’s Alpha, among others. evaluations, though, account complexities decisions code segment text. words, deciding apply code snippet text might considered equivalent level agreement decision apply code snippet text. QCoder aims make inter-rater reliability assessments easier effective traditional approaches allowing direct comparisons differences codebooks generates. Privacy concerns. Qualitative data often includes personally-identifying information. Quantitative approaches deidentification always applicable qualitative datasets text-based data includes rich descriptions may elevate risk re-identification. Furthermore, qualitative data tends unstructured ways make systematic approaches de-identification difficult implement. QDA software, , needs account complexities. Reproducibility. Qualitative research communities, particularly communities employing methods probe human social behavior (ethnography), fiercely debate whether qualitative research meant reproducible. words, researchers argue human social behavior contextually bound moments time, physical settings, generally fluid nature phenomena study. Accepting dispute valid, striving develop package can facilitate level reproduction data analysis. approach centers production codebooks. Qualitative researchers create codebooks coding data. codebooks match code description code used. creation codebook iterative process concurrent coding process. Codes routinely combined, split shifted researcher analysis. Codebooks way researcher indicate members research team apply codes data. Historically, code books standard across different QDA packages. benefit standard codebook format compared across projects even project iterates. Using Git version control codebook created prevent mistakes teaching learning tool qualitative research. Additionally, codebooks contain sensitive private data shared made publicly available. One envision capacity researchers share codebooks research follows draw existing codes future research. key characteristic QCoder exposes QDA processes critique ways proprietary software excludes. example, unreasonable expect researchers interested reviewing reproducing analysis done manuscript pay license perform task hand.
